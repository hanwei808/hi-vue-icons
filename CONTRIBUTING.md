# Contribution Guides

## Development

### Install Dependencies

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

### Icons

Fetch icon sources:

```bash
yarn download -f
```

This script would download icon packs as zip files from their Github repositories. Although it could be achieved more easily via "git submodule", too many submodules brings git too much loads and reduces its speed.

Then, re-generate files under `package/icons` automatically:

```bash
yarn icons
```

### Dev

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Build

```bash
yarn build
```
